            <p><strong>HTML: </strong>Welcome to Intro to HTML! First, we’ll dive into HTML, which will structure the elements in our webpage. Next, we’ll move onto CSS, which will help style the webpage. Lastly, we’ll focus more on the layout to make sure everything is distributed how we want.</p>
            <p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. This is the same “Hypertext” included in the “http” you see at the start of URLs in the browser, as it’s part of how browsers will know how to render what you provide. By the end of this lesson, you’ll be able to use HTML to add elements to display within a browser window, just as you would do with a webpage.</p>
            <p>HTML is a common starting point for those looking to get into web development. Later in the course, you’ll combine it with CSS, and even later in the Nanodegree, with Javascript, to create a full web experience. HTML itself is very much the basic building block of the web.</p>
